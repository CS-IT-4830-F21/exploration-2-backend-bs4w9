# Exploration #2: Backend

**NOTE: Although this is the real documentation, there may be updates. If there are updates, I will not be able to update the template, therefore Canvas will be the master branch for the challenge or exploration requirements. I will try to post an announcement when there are changes made so you know.**

_Due Saturday, October 9 at 11:59:00pm_

_Submit through GitHub Classroom **AND** Canvas_

## Overview

For this assignment, you **may** build off of your first exploration if you choose, however it is not required, you can start a completely new and different exploration. However, for this one you need to switch to the opposite between the frontend and the backend, _i.e._ if your Exploration 1 was based on Angular, CSS frameworks, or something for frontend, then explore something in the backend: Node, Google Cloud, Firebase, MongoDB, etc. If you developed something for the backend on the first exploration, then the same goes, explore some frontend concepts. Essentially select the opposite side of fullstack development. If you did neither of those then pick and choose one of them.

## Getting Started and GitHub Submission Link

To start the challenge, go to the link posted above at the beginning.

Link your account, clone the repository, start a new `dev` go into the code directory, and create your backend application

Make sure you start a new development branch at the minimum. Technically you should have a branch for each feature. Then, the master branch will be the production branch. Implement and do several commits. Every time you save, do a commit. Every now and then, merge the code from the development to the master (Every time you get to a good stopping point, for this exploration you can merge after each requirement you complete). At the end, when you are finished, do the final commit to development, and then the final merge to master.

**Note:** At the end, **_before the deadline, make sure you push the master and development branch back to the origin for grading_**. You can also push up any other branches you created so we can see all your commits.

**Note:** In the industry it is common to make a branch for each task or feature. For example, you may have a "login" branch where you work on login page and functionality, then you may have another branch called "homepage" where you have the homepage and functionality, and so on.

**If you work the entire time on master, you will get points deducted.** This is not a good industry practice.

After pushing back to origin for the final submission, I recommend to go to your GitHub repository on GitHub, download the repository which will give you a zip file of your repo on your local machine, then submit that zip to canvas as a backup. The submission will require both on GitHub and Canvas.

**Note:** If you do not submit on GitHub Classroom then points will be deducted. In addition, if you do not submit to Canvas, then points will be deducted.

**Note:** If you work on the master branch the entire time, points will be deducted. Create a development branch and work from there.

## Deliverables

The deliverables are the same as Exploration 1:

### 1. Sources

**Where** did you learn and **what** helped you figure it out? Provide a link to the topic you are investigating and any resources that help you along the way.

**Help with Decision:** If you need help on making a decision, try to select a back-end framework that you want to learn ... or better yet, a back-end framework that a company you are interested in is wanting their candidates to know. Then go out and learn as much as you can in the amount of time given.

**Professor Wergeles' Recommendation:** Knock out two birds with one stone ... either select topics that will also help you get a job ... or try to get ready for material in this course. For this course, we will be going over Node and MongoDB, as well as Firebase, so both of those would be good to explore so when we get to the lectures and challenges, you will already be familiar with them.

### 2. Code

What did you make? Provide samples of code, showing what you learned. These samples can be demos. They donâ€™t need to be polished; they just need to demonstrate what you experimented with ... like prototypes.

### 3. Recap

How did it go? Write about the topic you explored and what you experienced. This is your documentation. The documentation is a journal-style document that details the stuff you have explored. You can think of it as a journal that reflects an overview of the task (title), what you learned (explanation), the problems you faced (what did you learn or what problems occurred), how you solved them (explain what you did or how you solved the problem), and references (make sure you reference your work!!). If you go back and run through the material again or think about the TA reading this journal, it should help to guide them through your findings. Almost like your own personal tutorial with explanations.

Your journal should be clear, easy to read, and be of some help.

**Note:** You can implement an ordered or unordered list similar to challenge 1 and 2 or you can make your own style. The main thing is that the journal is clear, easy to read, and when the TA follows it, your "tutorial" actually works.

_If you are unclear what you need to do for this, then please let me or TAs know._

## Tasks

1. Create a post on the _Exploration 2_ discussion board with your sources, links to running code, and recap **(30 points)**.
   - I want students to use this for ideas, motivation, and to get involved with the class.
   - **However, if two explorations are thought to be copied off each other or cheating is suspected, then no points will be rewarded.**
   - What exactly should be on the discussion board?
     1. Links to the documentation
     2. Components you explored
     3. Trouble shooting tidbits
     4. Links to your running code on your instance or GitHub
        - Show off your work !!
        - But do not share the actual code itself
     5. Your journal
        - The journal should help someone to guide them through your findings and show off how much you explored. Almost like your own personal tutorial
        - Can be a minified version so students do not see your code
        - Do **not** post your code on the discussion board
2. You push and zip your sources, links to code, the actual code files, the recap, etc. to the GitHub classroom remote repository listed above. After the repository is uploaded to the remote, I recommend you download your remote repository as a zip file from GitHub, and submit the GitHub zip file to Canvas that way you don't include unnecessary files like `node_modules`. When you submit the zip file on canvas you will name it `<Pawprint>Exploration2.zip` and submit it on canvas as backup.
   - If your pawprint is abc123 then the zip file will be named `Abc123Exploration2.zip`
   - What exactly should be in the zip file? **(120 points)**
     1. A folder for all your code, labeled "code" **(40 points)**
        - This will contain the html, css, javascript, configuration files, php, and any other code you wrote for the exploration. The more the better.
        - The code will **not** be published on the discussion board
     2. A document that contains links to the documentation, components you explored, trouble shooting tidbits, your GitHub Repository Link, and a link to your running code on your instance (there needs to be some example of your exploration running on the AWS server). The document should be named "Sources" with the corresponding file extension .md **(20 points)**
        - For example: `<Pawpring>Sources.md` so if your pawpring is abc123 then the file would be named `Abc123Sources.md`
        - Do not submit a text file or a word document
     3. Your journal that reflects what you learned, problems you faced, and how you solved them. The journal will be named "journal" with the corresponding file extension .md **(40 points)**
        - For example: `<Pawpring>Journal.md` so if your pawprint is abc123 then the file would be named `Abc123Journal.md`
        - Your journal should be clear, easy to read, and be of some help. If the TA is reading it, the journal should guide them through your findings and it should show off how much you explored.
        - Do not submit a text file or a word document, make sure it is a nicely formatted MarkDown file otherwise you will get points deducted
     4. A folder for all your screenshots. The folder will be named `[Pawprint]Screenshots` which will contain screenshots of code running on the instance with the system clock in the screenshots. **(20 points)**
        - The system clock must include the date and time to be valid
        - You should have a few screenshots with your instances URL in them
        - For example, you might take a screenshot for each of the pages you implemented running on your instance with the system clock in them
        - You should take screenshots of **all** of the completed code
        - The more screenshots the better
        - Make sure you submit these screenshots with your submission before the due date otherwise they will not be considered valid.

**Note:** I plan to have students submit on GitHub and Canvas. The primary source of the submission will be on GitHub classroom and then we will submit a backup of the exact same submission on Canvas. Once you have your exploration finished and submitted on GitHub classroom, download the zip file from GitHub classroom, name the zip file correctly using the naming convention listed above, and then submit that zip file on Canvas as backup.

**Note:** You will submit your sources, links to code, the actual code files, the recap, screenshots, etc. on Github Classroom and then download your repo to a zip file named `[Pawprint]Exploration2.zip` and submit it on canvas to be graded **Make sure Github and Canvas are both up-to-date and have the same submission. (120 points)**.
